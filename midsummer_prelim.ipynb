She lingers my desires,\\nLike to a step-dame or a dowager,\\nLong withering out a young man’s revenue.\\n\\nHIPPOLYTA.\\nFour days will quickly steep themselves in night;\\nFour nights will quickly dream away the time;\\nAnd then the moon, like to a silver bow\\nNew bent in heaven, shall behold the night\\nOf our solemnities.\\n\\nTHESEUS.\\nGo, Philostrate,\\nStir up the Athenian youth to merriments;\\nAwake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;\\nTurn melancholy forth to funerals;\\nThe pale companion is not for our pomp.\\n\\n [_Exit Philostrate._]\\n\\nHippolyta, I woo’d thee with my sword,\\nAnd won thy love doing thee injuries;\\nBut I will wed thee in another key,\\nWith pomp, with triumph, and with revelling.\\n\\n Enter Egeus, Hermia, Lysander and Demetrius.\\n\\nEGEUS.\\nHappy be Theseus, our renownèd Duke!\\n\\nTHESEUS.\\nThanks, good Egeus. What’s the news with thee?\\n\\nEGEUS.\\nFull of vexation come I, with complaint\\nAgainst my child, my daughter Hermia.\\nStand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,\\nThis man hath my consent to marry her.\\nStand forth, Lysander. And, my gracious Duke,\\nThis man hath bewitch’d the bosom of my child.\\nThou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,\\nAnd interchang’d love-tokens with my child.\\nThou hast by moonlight at her window sung,\\nWith feigning voice, verses of feigning love;\\nAnd stol’n the impression of her fantasy\\nWith bracelets of thy hair, rings, gauds, conceits,\\nKnacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats (messengers\\nOf strong prevailment in unharden’d youth)\\nWith cunning hast thou filch’d my daughter’s heart,\\nTurn’d her obedience (which is due to me)\\nTo stubborn harshness. And, my gracious Duke,\\nBe it so she will not here before your grace\\nConsent to marry with Demetrius,\\nI beg the ancient privilege of Athens:\\nAs she is mine I may dispose of her;\\nWhich shall be either to this gentleman\\nOr to her death, according to our law\\nImmediately provided in that case.\\n\\nTHESEUS.\\nWhat say you, Hermia? Be advis’d, fair maid.\\nTo you your father should be as a god;\\nOne that compos’d your beauties, yea, and one\\nTo whom you are but as a form in wax\\nBy him imprinted, and within his power\\nTo leave the figure, or disfigure it.\\nDemetrius is a worthy gentleman.\\n\\nHERMIA.\\nSo is Lysander.\\n\\nTHESEUS.\\nIn himself he is.\\nBut in this kind, wanting your father’s voice,\\nThe other must be held the worthier.\\n\\nHERMIA.\\nI would my father look’d but with my eyes.\\n\\nTHESEUS.\\nRather your eyes must with his judgment look.\\n\\nHERMIA.\\nI do entreat your Grace to pardon me.\\nI know not by what power I am made bold,\\nNor how it may concern my modesty\\nIn such a presence here to plead my thoughts:\\nBut I beseech your Grace that I may know\\nThe worst that may befall me in this case,\\nIf I refuse to wed Demetrius.\\n\\nTHESEUS.\\nEither to die the death, or to abjure\\nFor ever the society of men.\\nTherefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,\\nKnow of your youth, examine well your blood,\\nWhether, if you yield not to your father’s choice,\\nYou can endure the livery of a nun,\\nFor aye to be in shady cloister mew’d,\\nTo live a barren sister all your life,\\nChanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.\\nThrice-blessèd they that master so their blood\\nTo undergo such maiden pilgrimage,\\nBut earthlier happy is the rose distill’d\\nThan that which, withering on the virgin thorn,\\nGrows, lives, and dies, in single blessedness.\\n\\nHERMIA.\\nSo will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,\\nEre I will yield my virgin patent up\\nUnto his lordship, whose unwishèd yoke\\nMy soul consents not to give sovereignty.\\n\\nTHESEUS.\\nTake time to pause; and by the next new moon\\nThe sealing-day betwixt my love and me\\nFor everlasting bond of fellowship,\\nUpon that day either prepare to die\\nFor disobedience to your father’s will,\\nOr else to wed Demetrius, as he would,\\nOr on Diana’s altar to protest\\nFor aye austerity and single life.\\n\\nDEMETRIUS.\\nRelent, sweet Hermia; and, Lysander, yield\\nThy crazèd title to my certain right.\\n\\nLYSANDER.\\nYou have her father’s love, Demetrius.\\nLet me have Hermia’s. Do you marry him.\\n\\nEGEUS.\\nScornful Lysander, true, he hath my love;\\nAnd what is mine my love shall render him;\\nAnd she is mine, and all my right of her\\nI do estate unto Demetrius.\\n\\nLYSANDER.\\nI am, my lord, as well deriv’d as he,\\nAs well possess’d; my love is more than his;\\nMy fortunes every way as fairly rank’d,\\nIf not with vantage, as Demetrius’;\\nAnd, which is more than all these boasts can be,\\nI am belov’d of beauteous Hermia.\\nWhy should not I then prosecute my right?\\nDemetrius, I’ll avouch it to his head,\\nMade love to Nedar’s daughter, Helena,\\nAnd won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,\\nDevoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,\\nUpon this spotted and inconstant man.\\n\\nTHESEUS.\\nI must confess that I have heard so much,\\nAnd with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;\\nBut, being over-full of self-affairs,\\nMy mind did lose it.—But, Demetrius, come,\\nAnd come, Egeus; you shall go with me.\\nI have some private schooling for you both.—\\nFor you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself\\nTo fit your fancies to your father’s will,\\nOr else the law of Athens yields you up\\n(Which by no means we may extenuate)\\nTo death, or to a vow of single life.\\nCome, my Hippolyta. What cheer, my love?\\nDemetrius and Egeus, go along;\\nI must employ you in some business\\nAgainst our nuptial, and confer with you\\nOf something nearly that concerns yourselves.\\n\\nEGEUS.\\nWith duty and desire we follow you.\\n\\n [_Exeunt all but Lysander and Hermia._]\\n\\nLYSANDER.\\nHow now, my love? Why is your cheek so pale?\\nHow chance the roses there do fade so fast?\\n\\nHERMIA.\\nBelike for want of rain, which I could well\\nBeteem them from the tempest of my eyes.\\n\\nLYSANDER.\\nAy me! For aught that I could ever read,\\nCould ever hear by tale or history,\\nThe course of true love never did run smooth.\\nBut either it was different in blood—\\n\\nHERMIA.\\nO cross! Too high to be enthrall’d to low.\\n\\nLYSANDER.\\nOr else misgraffèd in respect of years—\\n\\nHERMIA.\\nO spite! Too old to be engag’d to young.\\n\\nLYSANDER.\\nOr else it stood upon the choice of friends—\\n\\nHERMIA.\\nO hell! to choose love by another’s eyes!\\n\\nLYSANDER.\\nOr, if there were a sympathy in choice,\\nWar, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,\\nMaking it momentany as a sound,\\nSwift as a shadow, short as any dream,\\nBrief as the lightning in the collied night\\nThat, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,\\nAnd, ere a man hath power to say, ‘Behold!’\\nThe jaws of darkness do devour it up:\\nSo quick bright things come to confusion.\\n\\nHERMIA.\\nIf then true lovers have ever cross’d,\\nIt stands as an edict in destiny.\\nThen let us teach our trial patience,\\nBecause it is a customary cross,\\nAs due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,\\nWishes and tears, poor fancy’s followers.\\n\\nLYSANDER.\\nA good persuasion; therefore, hear me, Hermia.\\nI have a widow aunt, a dowager\\nOf great revenue, and she hath no child.\\nFrom Athens is her house remote seven leagues,\\nAnd she respects me as her only son.\\nThere, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee,\\nAnd to that place the sharp Athenian law\\nCannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,\\nSteal forth thy father’s house tomorrow night;\\nAnd in the wood, a league without the town\\n(Where I did meet thee once with Helena\\nTo do observance to a morn of May),\\nThere will I stay for thee.\\n\\nHERMIA.\\nMy good Lysander!\\nI swear to thee by Cupid’s strongest bow,\\nBy his best arrow with the golden head,\\nBy the simplicity of Venus’ doves,\\nBy that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,\\nAnd by that fire which burn’d the Carthage queen\\nWhen the false Trojan under sail was seen,\\nBy all the vows that ever men have broke\\n(In number more than ever women spoke),\\nIn that same place thou hast appointed me,\\nTomorrow truly will I meet with thee.\\n\\nLYSANDER.\\nKeep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.\\n\\n Enter Helena.\\n\\nHERMIA.\\nGod speed fair Helena! Whither away?\\n\\nHELENA.\\nCall you me fair? That fair again unsay.\\nDemetrius loves your fair. O happy fair!\\nYour eyes are lode-stars and your tongue’s sweet air\\nMore tuneable than lark to shepherd’s ear,\\nWhen wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.\\nSickness is catching. O were favour so,\\nYours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go.\\nMy ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,\\nMy tongue should catch your tongue’s sweet melody.\\nWere the world mine, Demetrius being bated,\\nThe rest I’d give to be to you translated.\\nO, teach me how you look, and with what art\\nYou sway the motion of Demetrius’ heart!\\n\\nHERMIA.\\nI frown upon him, yet he loves me still.\\n\\nHELENA.\\nO that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!\\n\\nHERMIA.\\nI give him curses, yet he gives me love.\\n\\nHELENA.\\nO that my prayers could such affection move!\\n\\nHERMIA.\\nThe more I hate, the more he follows me.\\n\\nHELENA.\\nThe more I love, the more he hateth me.\\n\\nHERMIA.\\nHis folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.\\n\\nHELENA.\\nNone but your beauty; would that fault were mine!\\n\\nHERMIA.\\nTake comfort: he no more shall see my face;\\nLysander and myself will fly this place.\\nBefore the time I did Lysander see,\\nSeem’d Athens as a paradise to me.\\nO, then, what graces in my love do dwell,\\nThat he hath turn’d a heaven into hell!\\n\\nLYSANDER.\\nHelen, to you our minds we will unfold:\\nTomorrow night, when Phoebe doth behold\\nHer silver visage in the watery glass,\\nDecking with liquid pearl the bladed grass\\n(A time that lovers’ flights doth still conceal),\\nThrough Athens’ gates have we devis’d to steal.\\n\\nHERMIA.\\nAnd in the wood where often you and I\\nUpon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,\\nEmptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,\\nThere my Lysander and myself shall meet,\\nAnd thence from Athens turn away our eyes,\\nTo seek new friends and stranger companies.\\nFarewell, sweet playfellow. Pray thou for us,\\nAnd good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!\\nKeep word, Lysander. We must starve our sight\\nFrom lovers’ food, till morrow deep midnight.\\n\\nLYSANDER.\\nI will, my Hermia.\\n\\n [_Exit Hermia._]\\n\\nHelena, adieu.\\nAs you on him, Demetrius dote on you!\\n\\n [_Exit Lysander._]\\n\\nHELENA.\\nHow happy some o’er other some can be!\\nThrough Athens I am thought as fair as she.\\nBut what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;\\nHe will not know what all but he do know.\\nAnd as he errs, doting on Hermia’s eyes,\\nSo I, admiring of his qualities.\\nThings base and vile, holding no quantity,\\nLove can transpose to form and dignity.\\nLove looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;\\nAnd therefore is wing’d Cupid painted blind.\\nNor hath love’s mind of any judgment taste.\\nWings, and no eyes, figure unheedy haste.\\nAnd therefore is love said to be a child,\\nBecause in choice he is so oft beguil’d.\\nAs waggish boys in game themselves forswear,\\nSo the boy Love is perjur’d everywhere.\\nFor, ere Demetrius look’d on Hermia’s eyne,\\nHe hail’d down oaths that he was only mine;\\nAnd when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,\\nSo he dissolv’d, and showers of oaths did melt.\\nI will go tell him of fair Hermia’s flight.\\nThen to the wood will he tomorrow night\\nPursue her; and for this intelligence\\nIf I have thanks, it is a dear expense.\\nBut herein mean I to enrich my pain,\\nTo have his sight thither and back again.\\n\\n [_Exit Helena._]\\n\\n\\nSCENE II. The Same. A Room in a Cottage\\n\\n Enter Quince, Snug, Bottom, Flute, Snout  and Starveling.\\n\\nQUINCE.\\nIs all our company here?\\n\\nBOTTOM.\\nYou were best to call them generally, man by man, according to the\\nscrip.\\n\\nQUINCE.\\nHere is the scroll of every man’s name, which is thought fit through\\nall Athens, to play in our interlude before the Duke and Duchess, on\\nhis wedding-day at night.\\n\\nBOTTOM.\\nFirst, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on; then read the\\nnames of the actors; and so grow to a point.\\n\\nQUINCE.\\nMarry, our play is _The most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of\\nPyramus and Thisbe_.\\n\\nBOTTOM.\\nA very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry. Now, good Peter\\nQuince, call forth your actors by the scroll. Masters, spread\\nyourselves.\\n\\nQUINCE.\\nAnswer, as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.\\n\\nBOTTOM.\\nReady. Name what part I am for, and proceed.\\n\\nQUINCE.\\nYou, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.\\n\\nBOTTOM.\\nWhat is Pyramus—a lover, or a tyrant?\\n\\nQUINCE.\\nA lover, that kills himself most gallantly for love.\\n\\nBOTTOM.\\nThat will ask some tears in the true performing of it. If I do it, let\\nthe audience look to their eyes. I will move storms; I will condole in\\nsome measure. To the rest—yet my chief humour is for a tyrant. I could\\nplay Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat in, to make all split.\\n\\n    The raging rocks\\n    And shivering shocks\\n    Shall break the locks\\n           Of prison gates,\\n    And Phibbus’ car\\n    Shall shine from far,\\n    And make and mar\\n           The foolish Fates.\\n\\nThis was lofty. Now name the rest of the players. This is Ercles’ vein,\\na tyrant’s vein; a lover is more condoling.\\n\\nQUINCE.\\nFrancis Flute, the bellows-mender.\\n\\nFLUTE.\\nHere, Peter Quince.\\n\\nQUINCE.\\nFlute, you must take Thisbe on you.\\n\\nFLUTE.\\nWhat is Thisbe? A wandering knight?\\n\\nQUINCE.\\nIt is the lady that Pyramus must love.\\n\\nFLUTE.\\nNay, faith, let not me play a woman. I have a beard coming.\\n\\nQUINCE.\\nThat’s all one. You shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as small\\nas you will.\\n\\nBOTTOM.\\nAnd I may hide my face, let me play Thisbe too. I’ll speak in a\\nmonstrous little voice; ‘Thisne, Thisne!’—‘Ah, Pyramus, my lover dear!\\nthy Thisbe dear! and lady dear!’\\n\\nQUINCE.\\nNo, no, you must play Pyramus; and, Flute, you Thisbe.\\n\\nBOTTOM.\\nWell, proceed.\\n\\nQUINCE.\\nRobin Starveling, the tailor.\\n\\nSTARVELING.\\nHere, Peter Quince.\\n\\nQUINCE.\\nRobin Starveling, you must play Thisbe’s mother.\\nTom Snout, the tinker.\\n\\nSNOUT\\nHere, Peter Quince.\\n\\nQUINCE.\\nYou, Pyramus’ father; myself, Thisbe’s father;\\nSnug, the joiner, you, the lion’s part. And, I hope here is a play\\nfitted.\\n\\nSNUG\\nHave you the lion’s part written? Pray you, if it be, give it me, for I\\nam slow of study.\\n\\nQUINCE.\\nYou may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.\\n\\nBOTTOM.\\nLet me play the lion too. I will roar that I will do any man’s heart\\ngood to hear me. I will roar that I will make the Duke say ‘Let him\\nroar again, let him roar again.’\\n\\nQUINCE.\\nIf you should do it too terribly, you would fright the Duchess and the\\nladies, that they would shriek; and that were enough to hang us all.\\n\\nALL\\nThat would hang us every mother’s son.\\n\\nBOTTOM.\\nI grant you, friends, if you should fright the ladies out of their\\nwits, they would have no more discretion but to hang us. But I will\\naggravate my voice so, that I will roar you as gently as any sucking\\ndove; I will roar you an ’twere any nightingale.\\n\\nQUINCE.\\nYou can play no part but Pyramus, for Pyramus is a sweet-faced man; a\\nproper man as one shall see in a summer’s day; a most lovely\\ngentleman-like man. Therefore you must needs play Pyramus.\\n\\nBOTTOM.\\nWell, I will undertake it. What beard were I best to play it in?\\n\\nQUINCE.\\nWhy, what you will.\\n\\nBOTTOM.\\nI will discharge it in either your straw-colour beard, your\\norange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your\\nFrench-crown-colour beard, your perfect yellow.\\n\\nQUINCE.\\nSome of your French crowns have no hair at all, and then you will play\\nbare-faced. But, masters, here are your parts, and I am to entreat you,\\nrequest you, and desire you, to con them by tomorrow night; and meet me\\nin the palace wood, a mile without the town, by moonlight; there will\\nwe rehearse, for if we meet in the city, we shall be dogg’d with\\ncompany, and our devices known. In the meantime I will draw a bill of\\nproperties, such as our play wants. I pray you fail me not.\\n\\nBOTTOM.\\nWe will meet, and there we may rehearse most obscenely and\\ncourageously. Take pains, be perfect; adieu.\\n\\nQUINCE.\\nAt the Duke’s oak we meet.\\n\\nBOTTOM.\\nEnough. Hold, or cut bow-strings.\\n\\n [_Exeunt._]\\n\\n\\nACT II\\n\\nSCENE I. A wood near Athens\\n\\n Enter a Fairy at one door, and Puck at another.\\n\\nPUCK.\\nHow now, spirit! Whither wander you?\\n\\nFAIRY\\n    Over hill, over dale,\\n        Thorough bush, thorough brier,\\n    Over park, over pale,\\n        Thorough flood, thorough fire,\\n    I do wander everywhere,\\n    Swifter than the moon’s sphere;\\n    And I serve the Fairy Queen,\\n    To dew her orbs upon the green.\\n    The cowslips tall her pensioners be,\\n    In their gold coats spots you see;\\n    Those be rubies, fairy favours,\\n    In those freckles live their savours.\\nI must go seek some dew-drops here,\\nAnd hang a pearl in every cowslip’s ear.\\nFarewell, thou lob of spirits; I’ll be gone.\\nOur Queen and all her elves come here anon.\\n\\nPUCK.\\nThe King doth keep his revels here tonight;\\nTake heed the Queen come not within his sight,\\nFor Oberon is passing fell and wrath,\\nBecause that she, as her attendant, hath\\nA lovely boy, stol’n from an Indian king;\\nShe never had so sweet a changeling.\\nAnd jealous Oberon would have the child\\nKnight of his train, to trace the forests wild:\\nBut she perforce withholds the lovèd boy,\\nCrowns him with flowers, and makes him all her joy.\\nAnd now they never meet in grove or green,\\nBy fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,\\nBut they do square; that all their elves for fear\\nCreep into acorn cups, and hide them there.\\n\\nFAIRY\\nEither I mistake your shape and making quite,\\nOr else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite\\nCall’d Robin Goodfellow. Are not you he\\nThat frights the maidens of the villagery,\\nSkim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern,\\nAnd bootless make the breathless housewife churn,\\nAnd sometime make the drink to bear no barm,\\nMislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?\\nThose that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Puck,\\nYou do their work, and they shall have good luck.\\nAre not you he?\\n\\nPUCK.\\nThou speak’st aright;\\nI am that merry wanderer of the night.\\nI jest to Oberon, and make him smile,\\nWhen I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,\\nNeighing in likeness of a filly foal;\\nAnd sometime lurk I in a gossip’s bowl\\nIn very likeness of a roasted crab,\\nAnd, when she drinks, against her lips I bob,\\nAnd on her withered dewlap pour the ale.\\nThe wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,\\nSometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;\\nThen slip I from her bum, down topples she,\\nAnd ‘tailor’ cries, and falls into a cough;\\nAnd then the whole quire hold their hips and loffe\\nAnd waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and swear\\nA merrier hour was never wasted there.\\nBut room, fairy. Here comes Oberon.\\n\\nFAIRY\\nAnd here my mistress. Would that he were gone!\\n\\n Enter Oberon at one door, with his Train, and Titania at another, with\\n hers.\\n\\nOBERON.\\nIll met by moonlight, proud Titania.\\n\\nTITANIA.\\nWhat, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence;\\nI have forsworn his bed and company.\\n\\nOBERON.\\nTarry, rash wanton; am not I thy lord?\\n\\nTITANIA.\\nThen I must be thy lady; but I know\\nWhen thou hast stol’n away from fairyland,\\nAnd in the shape of Corin sat all day\\nPlaying on pipes of corn, and versing love\\nTo amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,\\nCome from the farthest steep of India,\\nBut that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,\\nYour buskin’d mistress and your warrior love,\\nTo Theseus must be wedded; and you come\\nTo give their bed joy and prosperity?\\n\\nOBERON.\\nHow canst thou thus, for shame, Titania,\\nGlance at my credit with Hippolyta,\\nKnowing I know thy love to Theseus?\\nDidst not thou lead him through the glimmering night\\nFrom Perigenia, whom he ravished?\\nAnd make him with fair Aegles break his faith,\\nWith Ariadne and Antiopa?\\n\\nTITANIA.\\nThese are the forgeries of jealousy:\\nAnd never, since the middle summer’s spring,\\nMet we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,\\nBy pavèd fountain, or by rushy brook,\\nOr on the beachèd margent of the sea,\\nTo dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,\\nBut with thy brawls thou hast disturb’d our sport.\\nTherefore the winds, piping to us in vain,\\nAs in revenge, have suck’d up from the sea\\nContagious fogs; which, falling in the land,\\nHath every pelting river made so proud\\nThat they have overborne their continents.\\nThe ox hath therefore stretch’d his yoke in vain,\\nThe ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn\\nHath rotted ere his youth attain’d a beard.\\nThe fold stands empty in the drownèd field,\\nAnd crows are fatted with the murrion flock;\\nThe nine-men’s-morris is fill’d up with mud,\\nAnd the quaint mazes in the wanton green,\\nFor lack of tread, are undistinguishable.\\nThe human mortals want their winter here.\\nNo night is now with hymn or carol blest.\\nTherefore the moon, the governess of floods,\\nPale in her anger, washes all the air,\\nThat rheumatic diseases do abound.\\nAnd thorough this distemperature we see\\nThe seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts\\nFall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose;\\nAnd on old Hiems’ thin and icy crown\\nAn odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds\\nIs, as in mockery, set. The spring, the summer,\\nThe childing autumn, angry winter, change\\nTheir wonted liveries; and the mazed world,\\nBy their increase, now knows not which is which.\\nAnd this same progeny of evils comes\\nFrom our debate, from our dissension;\\nWe are their parents and original.\\n\\nOBERON.\\nDo you amend it, then. It lies in you.\\nWhy should Titania cross her Oberon?\\nI do but beg a little changeling boy\\nTo be my henchman.\\n\\nTITANIA.\\nSet your heart at rest;\\nThe fairyland buys not the child of me.\\nHis mother was a vot’ress of my order,\\nAnd in the spicèd Indian air, by night,\\nFull often hath she gossip’d by my side;\\nAnd sat with me on Neptune’s yellow sands,\\nMarking th’ embarkèd traders on the flood,\\nWhen we have laugh’d to see the sails conceive,\\nAnd grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;\\nWhich she, with pretty and with swimming gait\\nFollowing (her womb then rich with my young squire),\\nWould imitate, and sail upon the land,\\nTo fetch me trifles, and return again,\\nAs from a voyage, rich with merchandise.\\nBut she, being mortal, of that boy did die;\\nAnd for her sake do I rear up her boy,\\nAnd for her sake I will not part with him.\\n\\nOBERON.\\nHow long within this wood intend you stay?\\n\\nTITANIA.\\nPerchance till after Theseus’ wedding-day.\\nIf you will patiently dance in our round,\\nAnd see our moonlight revels, go with us;\\nIf not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.\\n\\nOBERON.\\nGive me that boy and I will go with thee.\\n\\nTITANIA.\\nNot for thy fairy kingdom.

First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself; which the\\nladies cannot abide. How answer you that?\\n\\nSNOUT\\nBy’r lakin, a parlous fear.\\n\\nSTARVELING.\\nI believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.\\n\\nBOTTOM.\\nNot a whit; I have a device to make all well. Write me a prologue, and\\nlet the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords, and\\nthat Pyramus is not killed indeed; and for the more better assurance,\\ntell them that I Pyramus am not Pyramus but Bottom the weaver. This\\nwill put them out of fear.\\n\\nQUINCE.\\nWell, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be written in eight\\nand six.\\n\\nBOTTOM.\\nNo, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.\\n\\nSNOUT\\nWill not the ladies be afeard of the lion?\\n\\nSTARVELING.\\nI fear it, I promise you.\\n\\nBOTTOM.\\nMasters, you ought to consider with yourselves, to bring in (God shield\\nus!) a lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing. For there is not a\\nmore fearful wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to look to\\nit.\\n\\nSNOUT\\nTherefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.\\n\\nBOTTOM.\\nNay, you must name his name, and half his face must be seen through the\\nlion’s neck; and he himself must speak through, saying thus, or to the\\nsame defect: ‘Ladies,’ or, ‘Fair ladies, I would wish you,’ or, ‘I\\nwould request you,’ or, ’I would entreat you, not to fear, not to\\ntremble: my life for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it\\nwere pity of my life. No, I am no such thing; I am a man as other men\\nare’: and there, indeed, let him name his name, and tell them plainly\\nhe is Snug the joiner.\\n\\nQUINCE.\\nWell, it shall be so. But there is two hard things: that is, to bring\\nthe moonlight into a chamber, for you know, Pyramus and Thisbe meet by\\nmoonlight.\\n\\nSNOUT\\nDoth the moon shine that night we play our play?\\n\\nBOTTOM.\\nA calendar, a calendar! Look in the almanack; find out moonshine, find\\nout moonshine.\\n\\nQUINCE.\\nYes, it doth shine that night.\\n\\nBOTTOM.\\nWhy, then may you leave a casement of the great chamber window, where\\nwe play, open; and the moon may shine in at the casement.\\n\\nQUINCE.\\nAy; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern, and\\nsay he comes to disfigure or to present the person of Moonshine. Then\\nthere is another thing: we must have a wall in the great chamber; for\\nPyramus and Thisbe, says the story, did talk through the chink of a\\nwall.\\n\\nSNOUT\\nYou can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?\\n\\nBOTTOM.\\nSome man or other must present Wall. And let him have some plaster, or\\nsome loam, or some rough-cast about him, to signify wall; and let him\\nhold his fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisbe\\nwhisper.\\n\\nQUINCE.\\nIf that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down, every mother’s son,\\nand rehearse your parts. Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your\\nspeech, enter into that brake; and so everyone according to his cue.\\n\\n Enter Puck behind.\\n\\nPUCK.\\nWhat hempen homespuns have we swaggering here,\\nSo near the cradle of the Fairy Queen?\\nWhat, a play toward?

Our intent\\nWas to be gone from Athens, where we might be,\\nWithout the peril of the Athenian law.\\n\\nEGEUS.\\nEnough, enough, my lord; you have enough.\\nI beg the law, the law upon his head.\\nThey would have stol’n away, they would, Demetrius,\\nThereby to have defeated you and me:\\nYou of your wife, and me of my consent,\\nOf my consent that she should be your wife.\\n\\nDEMETRIUS.\\nMy lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,\\nOf this their purpose hither to this wood;\\nAnd I in fury hither follow’d them,\\nFair Helena in fancy following me.\\nBut, my good lord, I wot not by what power,\\n(But by some power it is) my love to Hermia,\\nMelted as the snow, seems to me now\\nAs the remembrance of an idle gaud\\nWhich in my childhood I did dote upon;\\nAnd all the faith, the virtue of my heart,\\nThe object and the pleasure of mine eye,\\nIs only Helena. To her, my lord,\\nWas I betroth’d ere I saw Hermia.\\nBut like a sickness did I loathe this food.\\nBut, as in health, come to my natural taste,\\nNow I do wish it, love it, long for it,\\nAnd will for evermore be true to it.\\n\\nTHESEUS.\\nFair lovers, you are fortunately met.\\nOf this discourse we more will hear anon.\\nEgeus, I will overbear your will;\\nFor in the temple, by and by with us,\\nThese couples shall eternally be knit.\\nAnd, for the morning now is something worn,\\nOur purpos’d hunting shall be set aside.\\nAway with us to Athens.

Do not you think\\nThe Duke was here, and bid us follow him?\\n\\nHERMIA.\\nYea, and my father.\\n\\nHELENA.\\nAnd Hippolyta.\\n\\nLYSANDER.\\nAnd he did bid us follow to the temple.\\n\\nDEMETRIUS.\\nWhy, then, we are awake: let’s follow him,\\nAnd by the way let us recount our dreams.\\n\\n [_Exeunt._]\\n\\nBOTTOM.\\n[_Waking._] When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer. My next is\\n‘Most fair Pyramus.’ Heigh-ho! Peter Quince! Flute, the bellows-mender!\\nSnout, the tinker! Starveling! God’s my life! Stol’n hence, and left me\\nasleep! I have had a most rare vision. I have had a dream, past the wit\\nof man to say what dream it was. Man is but an ass if he go about to\\nexpound this dream. Methought I was—there is no man can tell what.\\nMethought I was, and methought I had—but man is but a patched fool if\\nhe will offer to say what methought I had. The eye of man hath not\\nheard, the ear of man hath not seen, man’s hand is not able to taste,\\nhis tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream was. I\\nwill get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream: it shall be\\ncalled ‘Bottom’s Dream’, because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it\\nin the latter end of a play, before the Duke. Peradventure, to make it\\nthe more gracious, I shall sing it at her death.\\n\\n [_Exit._]\\n\\n\\nSCENE II. Athens.

Out of doubt he is transported.\\n\\nFLUTE.\\nIf he come not, then the play is marred. It goes not forward, doth it?\\n\\nQUINCE.\\nIt is not possible. You have not a man in all Athens able to discharge\\nPyramus but he.\\n\\nFLUTE.\\nNo, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in Athens.\\n\\nQUINCE.\\nYea, and the best person too, and he is a very paramour for a sweet\\nvoice.\\n\\n\\nFLUTE.\\nYou must say paragon. A paramour is, God bless us, a thing of naught.\\n\\n Enter Snug.\\n\\nSNUG\\nMasters, the Duke is coming from the temple, and there is two or three\\nlords and ladies more married. If our sport had gone forward, we had\\nall been made men.\\n\\nFLUTE.\\nO sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life;\\nhe could not have ’scaped sixpence a day. An the Duke had not given him\\nsixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I’ll be hanged. He would have\\ndeserved it: sixpence a day in Pyramus, or nothing.\\n\\n Enter Bottom.\\n\\nBOTTOM.\\nWhere are these lads? Where are these hearts?\\n\\nQUINCE.\\nBottom! O most courageous day! O most happy hour!\\n\\nBOTTOM.\\nMasters, I am to discourse wonders: but ask me not what; for if I tell\\nyou, I am not true Athenian. I will tell you everything, right as it\\nfell out.\\n\\nQUINCE.\\nLet us hear, sweet Bottom.\\n\\nBOTTOM.\\nNot a word of me. All that I will tell you is, that the Duke hath\\ndined. Get your apparel together, good strings to your beards, new\\nribbons to your pumps; meet presently at the palace; every man look\\no’er his part. For the short and the long is, our play is preferred. In\\nany case, let Thisbe have clean linen; and let not him that plays the\\nlion pare his nails, for they shall hang out for the lion’s claws. And\\nmost dear actors, eat no onions nor garlick, for we are to utter sweet\\nbreath; and I do not doubt but to hear them say it is a sweet comedy.\\nNo more words. Away!

For all the rest,\\nLet Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain,\\nAt large discourse while here they do remain.\\n\\n [_Exeunt Prologue, Pyramus, Thisbe, Lion and Moonshine._]\\n\\nTHESEUS.\\nI wonder if the lion be to speak.\\n\\nDEMETRIUS.\\nNo wonder, my lord. One lion may, when many asses do.\\n\\nWALL.\\nIn this same interlude it doth befall\\nThat I, one Snout by name, present a wall:\\nAnd such a wall as I would have you think\\nThat had in it a crannied hole or chink,\\nThrough which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisbe,\\nDid whisper often very secretly.\\nThis loam, this rough-cast, and this stone, doth show\\nThat I am that same wall; the truth is so:\\nAnd this the cranny is, right and sinister,\\nThrough which the fearful lovers are to whisper.\\n\\nTHESEUS.\\nWould you desire lime and hair to speak better?\\n\\nDEMETRIUS.\\nIt is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse, my lord.\\n\\nTHESEUS.\\nPyramus draws near the wall; silence.\\n\\n Enter Pyramus.\\n\\nPYRAMUS.\\nO grim-look’d night!

You shall see it\\nwill fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.\\n\\n Enter Thisbe.\\n\\nTHISBE.\\nO wall, full often hast thou heard my moans,\\nFor parting my fair Pyramus and me.\\nMy cherry lips have often kiss’d thy stones,\\nThy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.\\n\\nPYRAMUS.\\nI see a voice; now will I to the chink,\\nTo spy an I can hear my Thisbe’s face.\\nThisbe?\\n\\nTHISBE.\\nMy love thou art, my love I think.\\n\\nPYRAMUS.\\nThink what thou wilt, I am thy lover’s grace;\\nAnd like Limander am I trusty still.\\n\\nTHISBE.\\nAnd I like Helen, till the fates me kill.\\n\\nPYRAMUS.\\nNot Shafalus to Procrus was so true.\\n\\nTHISBE.\\nAs Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.\\n\\nPYRAMUS.\\nO kiss me through the hole of this vile wall.\\n\\nTHISBE.\\nI kiss the wall’s hole, not your lips at all.\\n\\nPYRAMUS.\\nWilt thou at Ninny’s tomb meet me straightway?\\n\\nTHISBE.\\n’Tide life, ’tide death, I come without delay.\\n\\nWALL.\\nThus have I, Wall, my part discharged so;\\nAnd, being done, thus Wall away doth go.\\n\\n [_Exeunt Wall, Pyramus and Thisbe._]\\n\\nTHESEUS.\\nNow is the mural down between the two neighbours.\\n\\nDEMETRIUS.\\nNo remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear without warning.\\n\\nHIPPOLYTA.\\nThis is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.\\n\\nTHESEUS.\\nThe best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst are no worse, if\\nimagination amend them.\\n\\nHIPPOLYTA.\\nIt must be your imagination then, and not theirs.\\n\\nTHESEUS.\\nIf we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves, they may pass\\nfor excellent men.

It is well; leave it to his discretion, and let us\\nlisten to the moon.\\n\\nMOONSHINE.\\nThis lanthorn doth the hornèd moon present.\\n\\nDEMETRIUS.\\nHe should have worn the horns on his head.\\n\\nTHESEUS.\\nHe is no crescent, and his horns are invisible within the\\ncircumference.\\n\\nMOONSHINE.\\nThis lanthorn doth the hornèd moon present;\\nMyself the man i’ the moon do seem to be.\\n\\nTHESEUS.\\nThis is the greatest error of all the rest; the man should be put into\\nthe lantern. How is it else the man i’ the moon?\\n\\nDEMETRIUS.\\nHe dares not come there for the candle, for you see, it is already in\\nsnuff.\\n\\nHIPPOLYTA.\\nI am aweary of this moon. Would he would change!\\n\\nTHESEUS.\\nIt appears by his small light of discretion that he is in the wane; but\\nyet, in courtesy, in all reason, we must stay the time.\\n\\nLYSANDER.\\nProceed, Moon.\\n\\nMOON\\nAll that I have to say, is to tell you that the lantern is the moon; I\\nthe man i’ the moon; this thorn-bush my thorn-bush; and this dog my\\ndog.\\n\\nDEMETRIUS.\\nWhy, all these should be in the lantern, for all these are in the moon.\\nBut silence; here comes Thisbe.\\n\\n Enter Thisbe.\\n\\nTHISBE.\\nThis is old Ninny’s tomb. Where is my love?\\n\\nLION.\\nOh!\\n\\n [_The Lion roars, Thisbe runs off._]\\n\\nDEMETRIUS.\\nWell roared, Lion.\\n\\nTHESEUS.\\nWell run, Thisbe.\\n\\nHIPPOLYTA.\\nWell shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with a good grace.\\n\\n [_The Lion tears Thisbe’s mantle, and exit._]\\n\\nTHESEUS.\\nWell moused, Lion.\\n\\nDEMETRIUS.\\nAnd then came Pyramus.\\n\\nLYSANDER.\\nAnd so the lion vanished.\\n\\n Enter Pyramus.\\n\\nPYRAMUS.\\nSweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;\\nI thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright;\\nFor, by thy gracious golden, glittering gleams,\\nI trust to take of truest Thisbe sight.\\n             But stay!

In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\\nwww.gutenberg.org\\n\\n\\n\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\n\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\nU.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\n\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\\nlocations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt\\nLake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to\\ndate contact information can be found at the Foundation\\'s web site and\\nofficial page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\n\\nFor additional contact information:\\n\\n    Dr. Gregory B. Newby\\n    Chief Executive and Director\\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\\n\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\nvolunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\nedition.\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"
