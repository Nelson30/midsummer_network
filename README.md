# Character Network Graph of A Midsummer Night's Dream
## Project Goal
* Create a character network graph of *A Midsummer Night's Dream*, inspired by Martin Grandjean's work, found [here](http://www.martingrandjean.ch/network-visualization-shakespeare/)
* Create a tutorial to show how I processed the script and created the network graph.

## Process
1. Pre-process script to get character lists and scenes
2. Define functions to find entrances and exits of characters
3. Enhance functions to track when characters are in a scene together
4. Use information about co-occurrences to create edges and nodes of a network graph
5. Draw network graph and format
